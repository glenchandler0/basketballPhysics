This is a two player 
game where one player
shoots objects at the 
hoop to gain points, 
and another player tries
to block the shots by 
jumping.

-Controlling the shooter:
All this player requires 
is the mouse. The large yellow 
square is stationary and 
does not move, every shot
by the player will come from
here, regardless of where
the mouse is clicked. Holding
down the mouse button, dragging
it, and releasing it, will create
a vector into which an object will 
then follow. It is almost identical 
to the mechanics of "Angry Birds".
Almost.

-Controlling the blocker:
All this player requires is the 
'W', 'A', and 'D' keys. 'W' is to jump,
where the blue square will jump 
and hopefully knock down the ball by 
hitting it. The 'A' and 'D' keys are for 
moving left and right. These keys set the
velocity of the large blue square to create
a sliding motion. If you hold it down, you 
increase velocity very quickly, and may not
be able to block the balls accurately. Beware.
As a the blocker, you can interact with all 
objects besides the basketball hoop
and the shooter.
